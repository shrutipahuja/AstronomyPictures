# APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)

This application lets users browse through images parsed from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. 

Each image has a title, date, image url, etc.

APOD has two screens:

<b>Screen 1: Image Grid Screen</b>

<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60269503/104133235-490afc80-53a8-11eb-9161-5c978294c9a8.png" width = "200" height = "400"/>
This screen displays the images created in a reverse chronological order in a grid like scrollable list.

When any image is clicked, the user is redirected to the Image Details Screen.

<b>Screen 2: Image Details Screen</b>

<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60269503/104133245-5aec9f80-53a8-11eb-957e-e229238fb5b8.png" width = "200" height = "400"/>
This screen is launched  when the user clicks on the image from the Images Grid screen.

This is a static screen which displays the image, image title, image explanation and the date stamp when the image was created.
